        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Why Marinade a steak?</h3>
        <p>Marinating seasons the meat, while tenderizing it to enhance texture as well as flavour.
           The Marinating process also promotes browning.</p>
        <p>We're not exaggerating with the title. This truly is the best steak marinade recipe in existence.</p>   
        <h3>Steak Marinade Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil: This top-rated steak marinade recipe starts with olive oil, which keeps the meat nice and moist.</li>
            <li>Sauces: You'll need Worchestershire sauce and soy sauce. Hot sauce is optional, but it's a great addition for people who appreciate a little heat.</li>
            <li>Lemon juice: The acidity from the lemon juice cuts through the other flavours, adding welcome brightness. The acid also helps tenderize the meat even further.</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings: This flavourful marinade is seasoned with dried basil, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, white pepper, and minced garlic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How Long to Marinate</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Thinner cuts, such as skirt or flanks steaks, should be marinated for 2-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Tougher cuts, such as top sirloin or sirloin tip, will benefit from marinating overnight (about 8 hours).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Use Steak Marinate</h3>
        <p>Pour the marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag.
            Marinate in the fridge for up to 8 hours. Remove steak from the marinate and shake of excess.
            Discard the remaining marinade. Cook or grill steaks to desired doneness.</p>
