        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What is a Bolognese?
        Bolognese is a meat-based sauce. Traditional Bolognese sauce incorporates ground beef, onions, tomatoes, and a variety of herbs and spices.
        The sauce is usually slow-cooked for several hours to allow the flavours to develop and the meat to become tender. This creates a rich, savoury
        sauce often served with pasta, and is sometimes used as a filling for lasagne.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>(16 ounce) package of spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oli</li>
            <li>3 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
            <li>carrot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 lbs lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar (white or brown)</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked though yet firm to the bite,
                about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.
                Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes.
                Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely
                cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes,
                tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture, bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat.
                Stir the fresh basil into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
        </ol>
